msgid "In [product] 4.10.1 <a href=\"https://docs.cs-cart.com/4.10.x/user_guide/manage_products/products/product_variations.html\" target=\"_blank\">product variations</a> are finally out of beta. They can do <a href=\"https://docs.cs-cart.com/4.10.x/user_guide/manage_products/products/simple_versus_configurable.html\" target=\"_blank\">everything that option combinations can, and more</a>. Option combinations are still available, but deprecatedâ€”we won't further develop that functionality. That's why we advise converting option combinations to product variations. There is a special tool that will allow you to <a href=\"[convert_url]\" target=\"_blank\">check everything and convert option combinations automatically</a>. The only reason not to do it is if you have third-party add-ons that rely on option combinations. Even then, some of these add-ons might not be necessary with variations."
