When someone tried to install Boxberry's add-on, its files replaced the default add-on.<br/><br/>That's why we have renamed the directory of our default add-on to *rus_boxberry* to prevent this. If you have any Boxberry shipping methods, they now use our default add-on. The third-party Boxberry add-on is still in the list of add-ons, but has been disabled. If you'd like to use it, disable our default add-on first. You can tell the default and the third-party add-ons apart by the developer name under the description: the third-party add-on has \"Boxberry\" there."
