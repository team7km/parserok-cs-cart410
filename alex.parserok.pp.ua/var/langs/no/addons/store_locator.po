While merging these add-ons, we have also made a few improvements:<ul><li>The list of pickup points is now located under <b>Administration → Stores & pickup points</b>. That way it will be easier to find.</li><li>The \"Pick up from store\" shipping method now allows you to set different rates and delivery times for different rate areas (locations). This allows you to show your customers more accurate delivery times and gives you more control over shipping rates for pickup points.</li><li>Every pickup point now has two settings: what rate area it belongs to (determines the rates) and in what areas to show it in (determines what pickup points will be available to the residents of a rate area).</li><li>The <b>Surcharge</b> field of each pickup point is no longer taken into account for shipping rate calculation. That's because the shipping rate is supposed to be specified in one place, and that place is now the shipping method. You'll still see the surcharge when viewing a pickup point in the admin panel. The value remains to help you adjust the shipping rates on the shipping method editing page.</li></ul><p><b>Please check your pickup points, then adjust the shipping rates of all your \"Pick up from store\" shipping methods accordingly.</b></p>"
